Your marker needs you to have done all the hard thinking for them.

Your marker wants your thesis to be so well structured and easy to read that they can skim. 

Your marker doesn't don't know ANYTHING about your project/research area, so they need you to hold their hand.

# 2. Are your topic sentences 
# doing their job?


---

# what is the job of a topic sentence?

The first sentence of every paragraph should give away the take home message.

It should be a general statement summarising a particular part of the literature. 
  + It should describe what has been found ACROSS studies. 
  + It is usually NOT about a specific study
  + It should do more than just tell the reader that some research has been done. 

---

# example 1a - too specific

*A study conducted by Phillips and colleagues (2015) found that participants aged 65-86 performed significantly worse than younger groups on tasks assessing comprehension of sarcastic exchanges.* Interestingly, there was no effect of age on the understanding of sincere exchanges (Phillips et al, 2015). Further, a meta-analysis across 23 theory of mind (TOM) studies showed that older adults performed worse on TOM tasks compared to younger groups (Henry, Phillips, Ruffman, & Bailey, 2013).

--

#### Problems
- "by" = passive
- emphasis on the study and who did it, rather than what they did and what they found 

---

# example 1b - better, but too general

*Much research has investigated the link between aging and social cognition.* For example, Phillips and colleagues (2015) found that while participants aged 65-86 had no problem understanding sincere exchanges, they found it more difficult  to understand sarcastic exchanges than did young adults (Phillips et al, 2015). This result is consistent with a recent meta-analysis of theory of mind studies, which showed that older adults performed worse on TOM tasks compared to younger groups (Henry, Phillips, Ruffman, & Bailey, 2013). 

--

#### Problems
- doesn't say more than "research in X area has been done"


---

# example 1c - just right

*As we age, our ability to understand how other people are feeling and what other people are thinking declines.* For example, Phillips and colleagues (2015) found that while participants aged 65-86 had no problem understanding sincere exchanges, they found it more difficult  to understand sarcastic exchanges than did young adults (Phillips et al, 2015). This result is consistent with a recent meta-analysis of theory of mind studies, which showed that older adults performed worse on TOM tasks compared to younger groups (Henry, Phillips, Ruffman, & Bailey, 2013). 

#### Strengths 

- general statement about a *pattern* of findings 
- sets the reader up to expect findings in a particular direction

It should read like a summary of your argument/rationale.

# all together now...oppenheimer (2005)

*When it comes to writing, most experts agree that clarity, simplicity and parsimony are ideals that authors should strive for. However, most of us can likely recall having read papers, either by colleagues or students, in which the author appears to be deliberately using overly complex words. There are many plausible reasons that the use of million-dollar words would lead readers to believe that an author is smart. Indeed, there is some evidence that complex vocabulary can be indicative of a more intelligent author.*

# 3. Do your paragraphs function as units of argument?


---

# A good paragraph should...

- cover only ONE idea
- start with a topic sentence
- all other sentences should be
  + explanation
  + examples
  + AND/OR evidence to back up the topic sentence
- use the 1:5:25 rule
  + 1 idea, ~ 5 sentences, no more than 25 words/sentence

# 4. Are you holding your ~~reader's~~ marker's hand? 


---

# Your job as the ~~writer~~ student is to make it easy for your ~~reader~~ marker. 

- make the intro "moves" that your reader expects
    + what is the problem/question, why is it important
    + what do we know about the problem/question
    + what do we NOT know about the problem/question
    + how does your project fill that gap in what we don't know
- write a funnel, not a "curvy lady"

# Your job as the ~~writer~~ student is to make it easy for your ~~reader~~ marker. 

  + strong topic sentences + predictable paragraph structure
  + make the links between ideas really explicit
  + use signposting
  + avoid vagueness and potential for confusion 
    + the undefined "this"
    + [see the Thesis Whisperer re vagueness](https://thesiswhisperer.com/2017/06/28/8346/)

# 5. Does your writing synthesise or simply describe?

---

# Some student writing reads like a list of study descriptions

*So & So (2014) did a study that involved X and found that Y. In addition, Joe & Co (2016) have found that A relates to B. Also, Big Dude and colleagues (2019) ran a study showing that manipulating X results in changes in B.* 

Your marker is REALLY tired, they don't want to have to think hard. 
You can help them by doing the hard thinking for them.  

= synthesis

---

.pull-left[

## What is synthesis?

- extracting the patterns in the literature
- highlighting similarities/differences across studies
- unpacking HOW a study supports an argument, rather than just stating it does
- writing as if you are the expert with an opinion

# Test for passive voice with the zombie test

*Participants were recruited for a study entitled ‘Being Australian’ and completed the questionnaire in supervised groups of 10–12, and were compensated for their time with course credit. They were informed verbally and in writing that their anonymity was protected. Completed questionnaires were placed in an opaque drop box, and participants were debriefed and given the opportunity to request a summary of the results of the study (Barlow, Louis, & Hewstone, 2009, p. 394)*

## Zombie example 1

It is *measured by* placing EMG electrodes on the facial muscles of interest and measuring the electrical impulses *produced by* the muscles as they respond to emotion evoking stimuli. 

(29 words)

--

Researchers measure mimicry using facial EMG electrodes that detect the electrical impulses generated when participants view emotional stimuli 

(`r emo::ji("down")` 18 words)


---

## Zombie example 2

A positive attitude towards the expressor may foster emotional mimicry and increase the *interpretation of* the emotional expressions as friendly. 

(20 words)


--

People who like each other are more likely to mimic and judge emotional expressions to be friendly. 

(`r emo::ji("down")` 17 words)


---

# Zombie example 3

Empathy facilitates the *formation of* strong social relationships *by* motivating helping behaviour. 

(12 words)

--

Empathy helps people build strong social relationships because it motivates them to help each other. 

(`r emo::ji("up")` 15 words)

2. what do we know about it?

3. what don't we know about it?

4. how does this project fill that GAP?

### 6 discussion moves

1. what do we now know about that problem?
<br>
2. how does that relate to what we knew before?
<br>
3. what can we say about theory/real world that we couldn't before?
<br>
4. what problems/limitations do we need to acknowledge?
<br>
5. what do we still not know... what are the next steps?
<br>
6. what is the take home message?
