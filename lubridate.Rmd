The best thing about open source software like R is that there are SO many learning resources.

tutorial = learning oriented, lessons that take the reader by the hand through a series of steps to complete a project/exercise, show the beginner can achieve something meaningful

how to guide = problem oriented, guides that take the reader through the steps required to solve a common problem, recipes/directions to do something specific

reference = technical descriptions of the machinery and how to operate it

discussion = explanations that clarify and illuminate a particular topic, background, context, explain why things are the way they are.

# 3 things I learned about lubridate

--

### 1. plotting with date components

--

### 2. converting characters to dates

--

### 3. how to make R read your dates as dates


---







---

# 1. Plotting with dates

Use date components within ggplot to plot by...

.pull-left[

## year(), 

## month(), 

## day(), 

## wday()

] 


.pull-right[

#### tips 

label = TRUE 

week_start = getOption("lubridate.week.start", 1)

Link to RStudio Cloud for demo

] 



---


# 2. Converting characters to dates

If your dates are in a consistent format, you can use... 

.pull-left[

### ymd()

### mdy()

### dmy()

... to convert characters to dates

]

# 3. how to make R read your dates as dates


Why did the test data parse as date format and the Taylor/Beyonce data not?


---

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
sales <- read_csv(here::here("data", "sales.csv"))

sales$released[[1]]
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
tests <- read_csv(here::here("data", "totaltests.csv"))

tests$test_date[[1]]
```

# my hypothesis

Data that is in year-month-day format will always parse as dates?

---

# collecting data to test my hypothesis

Enter your birthday 3 times

- as you like
- using a calendar widget
- in year-month-day format (ISO 8601)

# Which dates does R think are dates?

### it depends....

---

#### using googlesheets4 package

- free date = list
- template date = date `r emo::ji("smile")`
- iso date = char

.pull-left[

#### from .xlsx

- free date = char
- template date = date `r emo::ji("smile")`
- iso date = char

] 

--

.pull-right[

#### from .csv

- free date = char
- template date = char
- iso date = date `r emo::ji("smile")`

# what to do with dates in a million formats?

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
diff_dates <- read_csv(here::here("data", "diffdatedata.csv")) %>%
  select(free_date)

head(diff_dates)

```

---

# breathe... there are only 3 formats

dmy()

ymd()

mdy()

And parse_date_time() is your friend...

---


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
diff_dates <- diff_dates %>%
  mutate(free_date_parsed = parse_date_time(free_date, c("ymd", "mdy", "dmy")))

head(diff_dates, 8)
```


- parse_date_time() failed to parse when there was no year. 

- it made an error when the year was only 2 digits. 



---

# Take home message

Lubridate is full of functions that make working with dates in R easier

- Use date components in ggplot with...
  + day(), wday(), month(), year()
- Convert characters to dates with...
  + dmy(), mdy(), ymd()
- Whether R will recognise your dates depends on
  + what format they are in
  + AND where you are reading them from

BUT parse_date_time() does a pretty good job `r emo::ji("smile")`
